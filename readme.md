# Dice Roller
This is my first Android App!

In this project, I learned: 
* running app on an emulator
* project structure
* what is the activity
* what is the layout
* Adding a button
* Connecting the button with the main Kotlin file
* findViewById
* onClickListener
* change text or resource
* adding image
* what are namespaces
* Gradle, build.gradle
* Vector drawables
